This project is Sudoku Game. A sample sudoku is given in the code and the game prints the solution. It will ask the user to input a sudoku and will print it's solution. 

Sudoku is a puzzle game. It's a square of 9X9 grids. There are some numbers (1-9) sprinkled in the grid and te task of the solver is to add number (1-9) in the empty grids so that, in the current row and column that number appears once. 
Also, the 9X9 is dived to 9, 3X3 grids, with each number appearing once, so the number added must also be unique in that particular 3X3. Below is a Sudoku Grid and below that is it's solution.
